**AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator** 
---

## âœ… **1. Manage Azure Identities and Governance**

### ðŸ§ª Scenario 1: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

You are asked to give a new team of developers read-only access to all resources in the resource group `DevRG`.

* Create an Azure AD group named `DevReaders`.
* Add three users to the group.
* Assign the **Reader** role to this group at the resource group scope.

### ðŸ§ª Scenario 2: Azure Policy for Compliance

The security team wants to prevent the deployment of virtual machines that donâ€™t use tags.

* Create and assign a policy that **requires the `Environment` tag** during resource creation.
* Test it by trying to create a VM without the tag, and another one with the tag.

---

## âœ… **2. Implement and Manage Storage**

### ðŸ§ª Scenario 1: Blob Storage Lifecycle Management

Contoso stores logs in blob storage that are only needed for 30 days.

* Create a storage account named `contosologs`.
* Create a blob container and upload sample logs.
* Set a **lifecycle policy** to delete blobs older than 30 days.

### ðŸ§ª Scenario 2: Secure Storage Access

You need to give temporary access to a user to download a confidential PDF file.

* Upload `financial-report.pdf` to a blob container.
* Create a **Shared Access Signature (SAS)** valid for 1 hour with read-only permissions.
* Test access via the SAS URL.

---

## âœ… **3. Deploy and Manage Azure Compute Resources**

### ðŸ§ª Scenario 1: Virtual Machine Deployment with Custom Script

Deploy a Linux VM and automatically install NGINX during deployment.

* Use a **custom script extension** to install the web server.
* Verify by accessing the VM's public IP.

### ðŸ§ª Scenario 2: VM Scaling and Availability

A web app running on a VM needs higher availability.

* Add the VM to an **Availability Set**.
* Configure a **scale set** that automatically adds instances when CPU > 70%.

---

## âœ… **4. Configure and Manage Virtual Networking**

### ðŸ§ª Scenario 1: Site-to-Site VPN Setup

Your on-premises office IP range is `192.168.0.0/16`.

* Create a **Virtual Network Gateway** and local network gateway.
* Simulate a **site-to-site VPN** by configuring both ends in Azure.

### ðŸ§ª Scenario 2: Network Security Group (NSG) Rules

Restrict access to a VM so that only HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) are allowed.

* Create a **Network Security Group** with these two rules.
* Associate it with the subnet the VM is in.

---

## âœ… **5. Monitor and Back Up Azure Resources**

### ðŸ§ª Scenario 1: Alert on Performance Threshold

The app team needs to know when a VM's disk usage goes above 80%.

* Use **Azure Monitor** to create an alert rule on the VM.
* Send notifications to an **email group** when the condition is met.

### ðŸ§ª Scenario 2: Backup Virtual Machines

Ensure that `FinanceVM01` is protected against accidental deletion.

* Create a **Recovery Services Vault**.
* Configure a **daily backup** with 14-day retention.
* Simulate a restore to verify.

---

## âœ… **6. Manage Azure Resources by Using ARM Templates, CLI, or PowerShell**

### ðŸ§ª Scenario 1: Deploy Resources Using ARM Template

You are given an ARM template to deploy a VNet and a VM.

* Validate and deploy the template using **Azure CLI** or **PowerShell**.
* Make sure it deploys to the correct region and resource group.

### ðŸ§ª Scenario 2: Automate Resource Tagging

The cloud governance team requires all VMs to have `Owner` and `Project` tags.

* Write a **PowerShell script** to find all VMs in a subscription.
* Automatically add missing tags to each VM.
